(Background on this error at: https://sqlalche.me/e/20/f405)",7.5," The query is syntactically correct and can be executed successfully. However, the error message indicates that there is an issue with the function ""avg"" because it does not support the data type ""character varying"" for the column ""medication_dosage"". This suggests that the data type of ""medication_dosage"" should be converted to a numeric type before applying the ""avg"" function. Additionally, the query does not specify any join conditions or tables related to patients, so it may not return the desired result of the number of patients who have taken medication and their average dosage. The question is not overly complicated, but it requires logical inference to determine the necessary modifications to the query.",UndefinedFunction
